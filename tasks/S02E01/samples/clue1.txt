This historic structure has been standing along the Vistula River for centuries, forming a crucial part of the city's medieval defenses. Located on a street whose name translates to "Granary Street," these red-brick buildings were once used to store grain and other goods. The narrow facades and steep roofs are iconic to this part of the city. If you walk down this street, you'll find yourself surrounded by the rich history of Grudziądz’s trade and defense systems, with the river always in view.
