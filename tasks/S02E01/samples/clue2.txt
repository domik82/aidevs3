Stretching along the Vistula River, this street is home to some of the most famous granaries in Poland. Its name reflects the very purpose these buildings once served—storing grain for the city and the surrounding regions. The street runs parallel to the river, offering a picturesque view of the medieval structures that have become a symbol of Grudziądz. If you find yourself on "Granary Street" in this northern Polish city, you're standing in the heart of its historical trade hub.
